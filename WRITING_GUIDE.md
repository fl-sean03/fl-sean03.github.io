# Writing Guide for Personal Site

This is an internal guide for writing and formatting content on the personal site. Not displayed publicly.

## Core Philosophy

### Voice
- **Direct and declarative.** State what things are. Don't hedge or over-qualify.
- **No hype or promotional language.** Let the work speak for itself.
- **Stakes claims without over-explaining.** Trust the reader to follow.
- **Professional objectivity.** Focus on what's true, not what sounds impressive.

### Positioning
- Bridge between academic and operator worlds. Not purely either.
- Focus on where work dies from friction, not from being wrong.
- Infrastructure problems masquerading as talent problems.
- The gap between research and deployment is a work problem, not a knowledge problem.

## Content Types

### Writings (Essays)
**Purpose:** Arguments and ideas for a general audience.

**Structure:**
- Each essay should have its own unique structure tailored to the argument
- Use `---` horizontal rules as section breaks
- Headers should be short and direct (e.g., "Cycle time", "What I see")
- Can have no headers at all if it flows better as prose
- Opening doesn't need a header if the first line is strong
- Closing doesn't need a header - just end cleanly

**Tone:**
- Accessible to general audience
- Avoid technical jargon - describe what things are rather than naming them
- Ground arguments in personal observation
- Connect to broader thesis without being redundant

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't copy the thesis structure ("The observation.", "The belief.", etc.)
- Don't use the three-bullet "why now" format (that's thesis-specific)
- Don't end with manifesto-style declarations and italicized invitations
- Don't repeat the same header patterns across different writings

### Thesis (Manifesto)
**Purpose:** Personal positioning and career thesis.

**Structure:**
- Uses "The [noun]." header pattern (observation, belief, position, window, bet)
- Three-bullet "why now" format is appropriate here
- Ends with personal commitment and invitation
- This is the ONE piece that uses this manifesto style

**This structure is reserved for the thesis only.**

### Projects
**Purpose:** Describe what you built and why.

**Structure:**
- No headers - flowing prose
- One bold bullet section for specifics (e.g., "**What it does:**")
- Open with the problem/context
- Explain what the project is
- Technical details in bullet list
- Connect to broader thesis at the end
- End with link

**All projects should follow this same pattern for consistency.**

## Formatting Rules

### Punctuation
- **No em-dashes.** Use commas or periods instead.
- Em-dashes (—) feel too stylized. Break sentences or use commas.

### Spacing
- Use `&nbsp;` for extra vertical space when needed
- One `&nbsp;` = subtle breathing room
- Two `&nbsp;` = usually too much
- Default paragraph spacing is usually sufficient

### Headers
- Each piece should have unique headers
- Don't reuse header text across writings
- Headers should fit the content, not a template
- Short and direct > clever or declarative

### Buzzwords to Avoid Repeating
- "Translation layer"
- "Integration layer"
- "Execution layer" (use sparingly, only when introducing the concept)

Instead of naming these concepts repeatedly, describe what they actually are.

## Writing Process

### Before Writing
1. Determine what type of content this is (essay, project, thesis)
2. Decide on structure based on the argument, not a template
3. Consider what makes this piece unique from others

### During Writing
1. Open strong - no throat-clearing
2. Each section should build on the previous
3. Ground abstract claims in concrete observation
4. Connect to thesis without being repetitive

### After Writing
1. Check for repeated buzzwords
2. Check for em-dashes (remove them)
3. Verify headers are unique from other pieces
4. Verify structure doesn't duplicate another writing
5. Read aloud - does it flow?

## Key Themes to Weave In

These are core ideas that can appear across writings, but should be expressed differently each time:

1. **Work dies from friction, not from being wrong.** Good ideas fail because of overhead, not because they're bad.

2. **Infrastructure is undervalued because it doesn't produce papers.** It just makes other work possible.

3. **Iteration rate beats brilliance.** The person who tests ten hypotheses learns more than the person who tests one.

4. **The gap is a work problem, not a knowledge problem.** The bridge doesn't get built because no one wants to do the unglamorous work.

5. **Results should compound but don't.** Researchers generate findings that never connect because the overhead is too high.

## Structural Comparison Reference

| Element | Thesis | Essays | Projects |
|---------|--------|--------|----------|
| Headers | "The [noun]." pattern | Short, unique, or none | None |
| Bullet lists | Three-bullet "why now" | Avoid or use sparingly | One "**What it does:**" section |
| Closing | Declaration + invitation | Simple ending with link | Connection to thesis + link |
| Tone | Manifesto/positioning | Argument/accessible | Concrete/technical |
| Structure | Fixed template | Unique per piece | Consistent across projects |

## Examples of Good vs Bad

### Headers

**Bad (copying thesis):**
- "The observation."
- "The window."
- "The bet."

**Good (unique to piece):**
- "Cycle time"
- "What I see"
- "Why now" (only if not three bullets)

### Describing Concepts

**Bad (buzzword repetition):**
> "The translation layer is where things die. Building the integration layer is how you create leverage."

**Good (describe what it is):**
> "The work of making discoveries work at scale is where things die. No one does it because it doesn't produce papers."

### Technical Detail

**Bad (in a writing/essay):**
> "Parameter extraction, simulation configuration, job submission, result validation against published benchmarks."

**Good (in a writing/essay):**
> "Finding the right papers, setting up the right tools, running the analysis, checking the results."

**The technical version is fine in a project page.**
