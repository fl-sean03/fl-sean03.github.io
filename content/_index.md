# Sean P. Florez

Ph.D. Candidate, Materials Science & Engineering
University of Colorado Boulder

I study where materials fail. Specifically at interfaces, the boundaries where different materials meet. This is where most advanced systems break down. It's also where academic expertise and manufacturing reality diverge most sharply.

My work spans national labs, defense programs, and the full arc from early-stage research to deployment constraints. I'm building the position that sits between pure academic and pure operator. That's where the translation actually happens.

**Currently:** Building intuition for materials translation across energy, defense, aerospace, and quantum applications.

**Interests:** Autonomous science systems, scientific computing infrastructure, materials qualification, industrial capacity.
