Research opportunities are unevenly distributed. Students at well-connected institutions find labs easily. Others don't know what exists or how to get in.

LabLink Initiative is a nonprofit I co-founded to fix this. We're building a multi-stakeholder pipeline connecting students, labs, and industry for research opportunities.

The core insight is that matching students to opportunities is an information problem. Labs have openings they don't advertise. Students have skills they can't signal. The right matches exist but don't happen because nobody can see the whole picture.

**What we're building:**
- AI-enabled Career Development Platform for student-opportunity matching
- Partnerships with energy coalitions and DOE workforce programs
- Frameworks for internship programs and community engagement

We submitted a proposal under DOE's Clean Energy Careers for All initiative, designed to train and inspire a diverse clean energy workforce.

This project applies the same thesis I hold for materials: the value is in translation and connection, not just in generating more supply. There are enough students and enough opportunities. The gap is in matching them.
