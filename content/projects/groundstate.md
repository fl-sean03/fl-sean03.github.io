Most materials research never leaves the lab. Not because the science is wrong, but because the path from "this works" to "this works at scale, reliably, for years" is where things die.

Groundstate is my attempt to close that gap. It's a Design-Make-Measure-Learn-Scale enterprise focused on shipping materials-based technology, not just publishing about it.

The first focus area is thermal interface materials (TIMs). These are the layers between heat sources and heat sinks in electronics, power systems, and industrial equipment. They're critical for reliability, and they drift over time in ways that are poorly understood.

My PhD thesis integrates directly with this work: building predictive models for interface stability under thermal cycling, connecting molecular-scale physics to macro-scale drift mechanisms.

**The approach:**
- Start with a real deployment problem (TIM reliability under cycling)
- Build the scientific understanding needed to predict behavior
- Use that understanding to design better materials and qualify them faster
- Ship products, not papers

This is the bet described in my [thesis](/thesis/): the highest-leverage position is at the intersection of atomic-level understanding and deployment judgment.
